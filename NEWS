# 0.3.15

* Support styles defined without a name

# 0.3.14

* Add ignore_empty_paragraphs option, which defaults to True.

# 0.3.13

* Always use forward slashes in ZIP paths. This should fix image handling on
  Windows.

# 0.3.12

* Make style names case-insensitive in style mappings. This should make style
  mappings easier to write, especially since Microsoft Word sometimes represents
  style names in the UI differently from in the style definition. For instance,
  the style displayed in Word as "Heading 1" has  a style name of "heading 1".
  This hopefully shouldn't cause an issue for anyone, but if you were relying
  on case-sensitivity, please do get in touch.
